Abstract
Background: Thyroid diseases can affect various bodily functions and often go unnoticed. To diagnose diseases that require surgical intervention, tools such as sonography and fine needle aspiration puncture are necessary. These tools help identify findings indicating malignancy or benignity criteria and other data that guide therapeutic decisions. The current study aimed to validate the relationship between sonographic results, fine needle aspiration, and final thyroid pathology. The research described the level of correlation between sonographic findings and fine needle aspiration, the sonographic report and the final pathology report, and the fine needle aspiration report and the final pathology report. Additionally, the research sought to identify the most common diagnoses in final pathology.

Methods: It consists of a retrospective descriptive observational study carried out with a sample of 95 patients undergoing thyroid surgery at the National Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Nutrition (INDEN), Dominican Republic, during 2019, with the aim of validating whether there is a relationship between the sonography findings, fine needle aspiration and the final pathology in surgical thyroid pathologies.

Results: A total of 95 patients were studied. The success rate in the sonography results compared with the benign final biopsy result was 100% and 45.9% with the malignant final biopsy result. In contrast the success rate in the fine needle biopsy results was 95.9% of the benign final biopsy and 28% in the malignant final biopsy results. Of the malignant final biopsy reports 84.6% were papillary carcinomas, 7.7% were follicular carcinomas, and 7.7% were medullary carcinomas.

Conclusions: The relationship between sonographic results, fine needle aspiration, and histopathological findings of surgical thyroid diseases was validated. The sonographic findings were specific to diagnose benignity and malignancy. The fine needle biopsy is useful to diagnose benignity and the final biopsy is the standard to confirm both benign and malignant pathologies.

Introduction 

Around three hundred million people worldwide suffer from thyroid disease. Surgical pathologies of the thyroid form a significant percentage of all thyroid diseases, including both benign and malignant tumors. According to the American Thyroid Association, 60% of people with thyroid disease are unaware of their condition (1). The Dominican Republic is vulnerable to these diseases due to notable risk factors such as obesity and iodine deficiency, and a general low level of health education, which is one of the lowest in Latin America. These issues have prompted the motivation to carry out a research project that can help improve the detection and diagnosis of surgical thyroid diseases in our country.

There are various thyroid pathologies that are similar and important to distinguish. The tools used for detection and distinction are thyroid sonography and fine-needle aspiration puncture, which play a vital role in managing the disease, and determining whether surgical intervention is necessary or not. Evaluating thyroid pathologies can be a tedious task if the tools we currently have are not utilized to their fullest potential. The data provided by each tool can go unnoticed and be deemed unimportant, but data found using a labeled tool may be sufficient to rule out or confirm malignancy (2). This can help decide whether to approach the disease surgically or clinically, thus avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures. For this reason, the investigation of the relationship between sonographic findings, fine-needle aspiration, and final pathology in thyroid surgery at the National Institute of Diabetes, Nutrition, and Endocrinology (INDEN) during 2019 was necessary to address the selected problem.

The research was conducted at INDEN due to its high flow of patients with endocrinological problems, with thyroid pathology being responsible for a considerable percentage. The center performed approximately two to three thyroid operations per week, and samples were taken from patients who underwent the three variables being investigated: sonography, fine needle aspiration puncture or biopsy, surgical resection of the gland (partial or total), and final histopathology in 2019.

The main objective of this work was to validate the relationship between sonographic results, fine needle aspiration, and final thyroid pathology. The study aimed to investigate the level of correlation between sonographic findings and fine needle aspiration, the sonographic report and the final pathology report, and the fine needle aspiration report and the final pathology report. Additionally, the research sought to identify the most common diagnoses in final pathology in 2019 and the characteristic sociodemographic variables of the worst types of neoplasms.

Materials and Methods

Ethics approval and consent to participant 


The data for this study was obtained from registered records of all patients who underwent thyroid surgery. We prioritized the ethical principles and criteria to ensure that no individuals whose information was used were offended or harmed in the process. This research was subject to approval by the ethics committees of both Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) and the National Institute of Diabetes, Nutrition and Endocrinology (INDEN).

Study population 

The population for this study included all patients who underwent thyroid surgery at the National Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology between January 1 and December 31, 2019, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. A non-probabilistic convenience sample was used, consistent with the total number of patients who underwent the procedure. Observation and documentary analysis of the clinical records of patients who attended the endocrinology and surgery consultation and later underwent thyroid surgery was performed. The indirect observation technique was used for data collection. A total of 95 patients participated, 86 females and 9 males, who underwent sonography, thyroid surgery, and final biopsy. Of the total, only 91 patients underwent fine needle aspiration. 52 came from the urban region, while 43 came from the rural region.

Ultrasound evaluation

The ultrasound data was analyzed with The High-resolution Ultrasound TI-RADS classification and scoring (3). Not all sonography reports report the TI-RADS, so sonographic descriptions were used to extrapolate this classification.




Fine-needle aspiration biopsy 

BETHESDA system for reporting thyroid cytopathology and scoring was used to report pathological findings found in thyroid nodules after fine needle aspiration (3). 



Statistical analysis
The information collected was organized through the formulation of tables and graphs corresponding to the results obtained in relation to the study variables. Electronic data processing was used with the Microsoft Word and Excel programs.

Discussion 

Out of the 95 patients, 90.5% (n=86) were female and 9.5% (n=9) were male. In the study published by Triantafillou et al (2018) in Greece, 1113 patients who underwent fine needle aspiration of the thyroid were studied, with females predominating at 81.1% and males at 18.9% (4). Showing similar demographic data of thyroids disease being predominant in females.

Using the TI-RADS criteria based on sonographic findings, it was observed that out of the total universe (N=95); 6.3% (n=6) belonged to TI-RADS I (benign); 13.7% (n=13) belonged to TI-RADS II (not suspicious for malignancy); 35.8% (n=34) belonged to TI-RADS III (mild suspicion for malignancy); 27.4% (n=26) belonged to TI-RADS IV (moderate suspicion for malignancy); and 16.8% (n=16) belonged to TI-RADS V. This same distribution of most results being TI-RADS II and III classification was reported in the study by Zhang J et al in 2015, which had a sample of 3980 thyroid nodules studied, 74.2% of the nodules were classified as TI-RADS II, 11.7% were classified as TI-RADS III, 13.5% were classified as TI-RADS IV, and 0.6% were classified as TI-RADS V (5). 

In the relationship between sonography and final biopsy, it was observed that out of 6 patients in TI-RADS I, 100% had a benign result. Out of 13 patients in TI-RADS II, 92.3% (n=12) had a benign result, while 7.7% (n=1) had a malignant result. Out of 34 patients in TI-RADS III, 91.2% (n=31) had a benign result, while 8.8% (n=3) had a malignant result. Out of 26 patients in TI-RADS IV, 80.8% (n=21) had a benign result, while 19.2% (n=5) had a malignant result. Out of 16 patients in TI-RADS V, 1 patient did not have a final biopsy, so out of a total of 15 patients: 60% (n=9) had a benign result, 26.7% (n=4) had a malignant result, and 13.3% (n=2) had an indeterminate result. In comparison with the study mentioned earlier by Zhang J et al (2015), out of 2953 nodules classified as TI-RADS II, 100% had a benign result. Out of 466 nodules classified as TI-RADS III, 98.7% had a benign result, and 1.3% had a malignant result. Out of 539 nodules classified as TI-RADS IV, 62.7% had a benign result, and 37.3% had a malignant result. Out of 22 nodules classified as TI-RADS V, 95.5% had a malignant result, while 4.5% had a benign result (5).

The BETHESDA classification was identified through fine needle aspiration (FNA) or fine needle biopsy (FNB) in 91 patients. No patient belonged to B-I (BETHESDA I), which represents a non-diagnostic biopsy or insufficient material. 53.8% (n=49) belonged to B-II (benign); 13.2% (n=12) belonged to B-IIIa (atypia of undetermined significance); 2.2% (n=2) belonged to B-IIIb (follicular lesion of undetermined significance); 2.2% (n=2) belonged to B-IV (follicular neoplasm); 24.2% (n=22) belonged to B-V (suspicion of malignancy); and 4.4% (n=4) belonged to B-VI (malignant). In the study published by Triantafillou et al (2018) in Greece, it was identified that "22.9% were characterized as non-diagnostic (B-I), 70.1% were diagnosed as benign (B-II), 3.1% were diagnosed as atypical/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (B-IIIa and B-IIIb), 0.9% were diagnosed as follicular neoplasm or suspicious for follicular neoplasm (B-IV), while 1.2% of cases were categorized as suspicious for malignancy (B-V) and 1.8% as malignant (B-VI)" (4).

In the relationship between fine needle biopsy (FNB) classification and final biopsy, it was observed that out of 49 patients with a benign classification, 95.9% had a final biopsy result that was benign, and 4.1% had a final biopsy result that was malignant. Out of 17 patients with cellular atypia, 70.6% had a final biopsy result that was benign, 23.5% had a final biopsy result that was malignant, and 5.9% had a final biopsy result that was indeterminate. Out of 25 patients with malignant FNB, 68% had a final biopsy result that was benign, 28% had a final biopsy result that was malignant, and 4% had a final biopsy result that was indeterminate. In comparison with the study by Lew et al (2011), 46% of all patients undergoing thyroidectomy had thyroid cancer in the final histopathology. Out of the FNB results that were non-diagnostic due to an inconclusive result, 76% had benign histopathology, and 24% had a malignant histopathology. Out of the FNB results that were benign, 85% agreed with the final histopathology, while 8.6% turned out to be malignant. Out of the FNA results that were malignant, 98% agreed with the final histopathology, while 2% turned out to be benign (6).

In the final biopsy, it was observed that out of the study population, 84.2% (n=80) had a benign result, 13.7% (n=13) had a malignant result, and 2.1% (n=2) had an indeterminate result indicating that this part of the population required immunohistochemical studies to have a more accurate and definitive diagnosis. Of the 13.7% that had a malignant result, 84.6% (n=11) were diagnosed with papillary carcinoma, 7.7% (n=1) with follicular carcinoma, and 7.7% (n=1) with medullary carcinoma. In comparison with the study by Anand et al (2020), 71% of the patients who underwent surgery had a benign final biopsy result, while 29% had a malignant final biopsy result. Of the malignant cases, 17% were diagnosed with papillary carcinoma, which was the most common neoplasm in that study, while 6% were diagnosed with follicular carcinoma (7).

Conclusion

Deriving from the results previously discussed, the relationship between sonographic results, fine needle aspiration, and post-thyroid surgery histopathological results was validated. General data such as age, origin, toxic habits, and the presence or absence of diabetes were used to verify if external factors such as these could affect the correlation between the three main variables of the study in thyroid diseases found. However, after data analysis, it was discovered that they did not provide a directly proportional correlation to the stipulated objectives.

When comparing sonographic findings with fine needle biopsy and final biopsy, it is demonstrated that this method is specific for diagnosing and differentiating benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. It was confirmed in the sonographic classification that the higher the TI-RADS, the higher the probability of malignancy in the fine needle biopsy, and this relationship was further reinforced with the final biopsy, showing that this relationship is correct. With sufficient sonography data, the second step in the research sequence can be taken, which is the fine needle biopsy sample.

In the relationship between fine needle biopsy (FNB) and final biopsy, it was observed that when FNB gave a benign result, 95.9% of the population had a benign result in the final biopsy, but when FNB gave a malignant result, only 28% of the population had a malignant result in the final biopsy. With these data, it can be concluded that fine needle biopsy is a reliable method for diagnosing benign thyroid pathologies, but not very specific for malignant pathologies.

Additionally, during the surgical procedure, it was observed that only procedures with total thyroidectomy had malignancy in the final biopsy, and of these, there was a predominance of papillary type with 84.6%. Finally, what was proposed at the beginning of the investigation is confirmed, that the final biopsy is the standard to confirm both benignity and malignancy in surgical pathologies of the thyroid, with sonography and fine needle biopsy being essential diagnostic methods to have a precise idea of the nature of the nodular lesion of the thyroid gland.
